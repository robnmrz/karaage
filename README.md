## ⚠️ Disclaimer

The core aim of **Karaage** is to enhance automation and efficiency in accessing publicly available manga content on the internet. The app itself **does not host any content**; rather, it acts as a streamlined tool to access manga that is already publicly available through external, non-affiliated sources.

### **Content Availability**
All content served through **Karaage** is publicly accessible. If a website is listed in the app, its content is already publicly visible. If any site owner believes their content should not be accessed through Karaage, they should take the necessary technical measures to prevent it.

Think of Karaage as a specialized web browser: while a regular browser makes multiple requests to load an entire site, Karaage focuses specifically on retrieving manga content in the most efficient manner.

### **User Responsibility**
- **Users are responsible for ensuring that their usage of Karaage complies with their local laws and regulations.**  
- The developers and maintainers of Karaage **do not have control over the content** served through the app.
- **Any copyright violations should be directed to the content providers**, not the developers of Karaage.
- Using copyrighted content from external sources **is at the user's own risk**.

## 📜 DMCA & Copyright Infringements

A browser is a tool, and its usage is determined by the user. Similarly, **Karaage does not store, distribute, or modify copyrighted material**. It only facilitates client-side access to publicly available content. 

If a copyright owner has concerns regarding specific content, they should **direct DMCA notices or infringement claims to the original hosting sites, not to Karaage or its developers.** As of writing, Karaage retrieves content from publicly available manga sources.

**⚠️ Do not harass the maintainer.**
